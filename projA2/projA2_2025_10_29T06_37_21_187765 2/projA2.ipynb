    "In this project, we will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict home prices. Then, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll think about the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study. This is especially relevant because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. \n",

    "Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",

These property tax assessments are based on property values estimated using statistical models considering multiple factors, such as real estate value and construction cost.\n",

    "However, this system is not without flaws. In late 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the office of Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios for producing \"[racially discriminatory assessments and taxes](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-cook-county-board-assessor-berrios-met-20170718-story.html).\" The lawsuit included claims that the assessor's office undervalued high-priced homes and overvalued low-priced homes, creating a visible divide along racial lines. Wealthy homeowners, who were typically white, paid less in property taxes, whereas [working-class, non-white homeowners paid more](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-cook-county-assessor-berrios-sued-met-20171214-story.html).\n",

    "The Chicago Tribune's four-part series, \"[The Tax Divide](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-tax-divide-investigation-20180425-storygallery.html),\" delves into how this was uncovered. After \"compiling and analyzing more than 100 million property tax records from the years 2003 through 2015, along with thousands of pages of documents, then vetting the findings with top experts in the field,\" they discovered that \"residential assessments had been so far off the mark for so many years.\" You can read more about their investigation [here](https://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/assessments.html).\n",

    "`k`-fold cross validation (CV) allows us to more accurately evaluate our models than a single train-validation split. In `k`-fold CV, every data point is used in model training at some point. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Heads up: You should use `k`-fold cross validation to evaluate the different models you create in Question 5, as you will have limited submissions per day on Pensieve to assess your test RMSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Project, we won't use `k`-fold CV to optimize for hyperparameters like we will in Lab 8, since OLS does not have any hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will use `k`-fold cross validation to generate `k` estimates of the test set RMSE. These `k` RMSEs might be helpful when deciding between models in Question 5.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will implement `compute_CV_error`. `compute_CV_error` should:\n",
    "1. Use `sklearn`'s `KFold.split` ([documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html))  function to generate `k` splits of the training data. Note that `KFold.split` returns the indices of the data for each split.\n",
    "2. For **each** split:\n",
    "    1. Assign the folds to training and validation based on the split indices and desired features.\n",
    "    2. Train the model on the training folds, and compute the RMSE on the validation fold.\n",
    "3. Finally, return a **list** of the RMSEs computed for each validation fold. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Hint:**  This should be very similar to your implementation of `compute_CV_error` in Lab 8, but instead of returning an aggregated average of the folds, return the list of `k` RMSEs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note:** The tests for this subpart only check the return value of `compute_CV_error` is a list of the correct length, 4cii will check for correctness."

Attempts will not carry over across days, so we recommend planning ahead to make sure you have enough time to finetune your model! \n",
    "\n",
    "The thresholds are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Points | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "Training RMSE | Less than 0.7 | [0.7, 1.0) | [1.0, 2.0) | More than 2.0\n",

    "Example intuition: Let's say for one data point our actual home price is $e^{12} \\approx \\$162,500$. The predicted home price is $e^{13} \\approx 442,000$. On the log scale, the actual home price is 12, and the predicted price is 13. So, our log error is 1. This is equivalent to a multiplicative error of $\\frac{\\$442,000}{\\$162,500} \\approx e \\approx 2.718$. "

You do not need to rerun the cell at the top of this notebook to complete Question 5. The autograder will have more than 4GB of memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 5 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of Datahub. By default, we reset the memory and clear all variables using `%reset -f`. If you want to delete specific variables, you may also use `del` in place of `%reset -f%`. For example, the following code will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier.\n",

    "## Question 5d: Defining The Pipeline Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**This question is graded.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Akin to Question 4, you should encapsulate as much of your workflow into functions as possible. In the cell below, you should select better features and define your own feature engineering pipeline inside the function `feature_engine_final`. Use of `.pipe` is not required, but you are welcome to incorporate it! \n",
    "\n",
    "**You must not change the parameters inside `feature_engine_final`. Do not edit the two lines at the end of the question cell below. They are helper functions that define a linear model, fit your data, and compute RMSE. If you do, you will receive no credit for this question.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional requirements:\n",
    "- Any feature engineering techniques that involve referencing `Sale Price` or `Log Sale Price` (for example, removing outlying `Sale Price` values from the training data) should be performed under the condition `if not is_test_set:`, which is provided in the cell below.\n",
    "- All other feature engineering techniques should be applied to both the training and test sets. This means that you should perform them under the condition `else:`, provided in the cell below.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `True`, your function should return only the design matrix, `X`.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `False`, your function should return both the design matrix and the response variable `Y` (the `Log Sale Price` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "-  Some features may have missing values in the test set but not in the training/validation set. Make sure `feature_engine_final` handles missing values appropriately for each feature.\n",
    "- We have imported all feature engineering functions from Project A1 for you. You do not have access to the `feature_func.py` file with the function body and definitions, but they work as defined in Project A1. Feel free to use them as you see fit!\n",
    "- You may wish to consider removing outlying datapoints from the training set before fitting your model. You may not, however, remove any datapoints from the test set (after all, the CCAO could not simply \"refuse\" to make predictions for a particular house!)\n",
    "- As you finetune your model, you may unintentionally consume too much Datahub memory, causing your kernel to crash. See `q5a` for guidance on how to resolve this!!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you run into any errors, the [Proj. A2 Common Mistakes](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/projA2/projA2.html) section of the [Data 100 Debugging Guide](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide) may be a helpful resource."

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately —— that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. Fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness but also what fairness —— and justice —— means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL —— a suburb in Cook County —— as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"

    "A fair model would have a small RMSE by having the predicted property values similar to the true property value. However, it is also important to note that just having a small RMSE doesn't necessarily mean it is accurate, as having an even distribution over different intervals is also important. In a fair model, we would want to avoid having RMSE spikes on certain subgroups as the model's total RMSE might be \"low,\" but its accuracy for some datasets (like expensive homes) can be very low. Low RMSE doesn't mean high accuracy throughout the datasets, as RMSE measures average error, not distributed error. It is possible to have low average error but high distributed errors. This means that certain groups' inaccuracy might be ignored and cause unfairness when analyzing the data. Therefore, for a model's predictions of property values for tax assessment to be fair, we must have low RMSE with even distribution of high accuracy."

    "\n",
    "## Question 8a\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in Project A1, RMSE—while a widely used and powerful error metric introduced in earlier lectures—is not always the most appropriate choice when evaluating the *fairness* of a property appraisal system. In Question 7, you already encountered some of RMSE's limitations, particularly its tendency to disproportionately emphasize errors in high-priced properties due to the squaring of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, rather than relying on RMSE, we will train and evaluate our model using another custom fairness metric. Specifically, we will examine the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**, which measures the average error as a percentage of the true value. This allows us to better assess whether the model is making relatively fair predictions across different segments of the housing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cells that follow, we’ll explore how MAPE varies across price ranges—comparing the model’s relative performance on inexpensive versus expensive housing. This helps identify whether the model systematically favors or disadvantages certain groups of properties based on their price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You'll notice that we’re no longer using `lm.LinearRegression()`, but instead have started using `minimize`. This is because `scikit-learn` does not allow customization of the loss function in their standard linear regression model. The approach shown below provides an equivalent way to train a linear regression model using a custom error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** These cells take quite a long time to run. Please be patient, wait, and avoid restarting the kernel or rerunning these cells more than necessary."
